# Minecraft Slime Launcher

A slim launcher for Minecraft in the development environment.

## Requirements (Delete on Release)

- The ability to launch Minecraft paired with ForgeGradle 7.
  - Down the road, we will want to be able to launch versions of Minecraft that use Java 8, old Bootstrap, and old FML.

## Purpose

SlimeLauncher is a standalone tool that allows users to launch Minecraft without needing to interface with the standard
Minecraft Launcher or third party solutions. ForgeGradle 6 and older have done this in the past, but creating a
standalone tool to do this allows for better separation of code and brings potential for other use cases down the line.
